1 . ðŸ§ª Coroutine Testing in Android with Jetpack Compose

Overview

This repository showcases a comprehensive approach to unit testing asynchronous logic built with Kotlin Coroutines within an Android application using Jetpack Compose.

The core focus is on implementing robust and reliable tests for MVVM ViewModels that handle coroutines, using standard practices like TestDispatcher and libraries like Turbine to assert the emissions of StateFlows and SharedFlows.

The accompanying video, rec.webm, demonstrates the fully functional app whose underlying logic is rigorously tested in this project.

Highlights in the Demo

The video primarily shows the functional, real-time aspects of the app, which are guaranteed by the strong test coverage:

Instant UI Recomposition: Observe how data changes, triggered by underlying asynchronous work, immediately update the Compose UI.

State Management: The application state remains consistent and predictable, a direct result of tested ViewModel logic.

Responsive Design: The Compose layout adapts smoothly to configuration changes.
